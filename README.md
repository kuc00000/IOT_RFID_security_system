### ■&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Introduction
▣ The project is part of the IITP Summer Program, and **Korean universities & Purdue university** participated together.<br>
▣ The members consist of 6 **Chung-Ang University** students and 1 **Purdue University** student.<br>
▣ This project's goal is to improve physical security with **RFID systems** and ensure that assets can be managed safely and efficiently.<br>
<br>
_It has the following advantages:_
#### **1. The research strengthens the management of equipment and personnel in various companies**
- This can make the use of the equipment and people become clearer so that the management becomes more convenient. 
- It also reduces the possibility of theft and loss. 
- Even if theft and loss occur, liability can be found from the person who used the equipment.

#### **2. The technology of security level based on RFID will classify the safety level according to the characteristics of different equipment.**
- Using the classification of security level, it will become more convenient to manage equipment.
- In addition, it can have a more precise concept for future buying of equipment.

#### **3. Based on the function of collecting information through RFID, epidemiological investigation can be carried out.**
- Through the time information stored when people pass the system, tracing the movement becomes effective.
